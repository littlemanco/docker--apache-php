# Clarification Request
<!--

  There are times where the answer for something simply isn't written down somewhere before, or that what's written
  down is not clear.

  For those times we have this issue exists to convey that we're looking for something that we can't find.

  Try and have a look in the project documentation before requesting clarification. These requests ultimately result
  in additional documentation, so if the question has been asked before it's probably in there somewhere.
